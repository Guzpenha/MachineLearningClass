# Machine Learning Class at UFMG 2017

Machine Learning class assignments at UFMG.

## TP1 - Feed Foward Network for MNIST

This assignment is to develop a two layer network that fits the MNIST digit recognition dataset,
using Cross Entropy as cost function and Sigmoid activation units. 

The experimental evaluation includes an analysis of the Empirical Error over epochs by different choices of learning rate, batch size, learning method (GD, Mini-batch GD and SGD) and
number of hidden units.

## TP2 - AdaBoostClassifier for categorical data 

This assignment is to develop a binary AdaBoostClassifier algorithm, using Decision Stumps as weak leaners, that works on categorical data and evaluate it using cross validation on [Tic-Tac-Toe Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Tic-Tac-Toe+Endgame).

The experimental evaluation shows how the classifier behaves when we use more weak base estimators.
